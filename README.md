# Hand_Gesture_Recognition

We created a classification model to train Hand Gestures from the HAGRID Dataset. We tried out various deep learning architectures like InceptionV3, VGG16, DenseNet and the ResNet family. Amongst all these architectures the ResNet152 proved to be the most efficient and predicted with an accuracy of nearly 75 percent. ResNet proved to be the most accurate as it works best while dealing with the issues of vanishing gradient descent in deep neural networks by the help of skip connections.
