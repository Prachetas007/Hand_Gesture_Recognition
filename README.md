# Hand_Gesture_Recognition

We created a classification model to train Hand Gestures from the HAGRID Dataset. We tried out various deep learning architectures like InceptionV3, VGG16, DenseNet and the ResNet family. Amongst all these architectures the ResNet152 proved to be the most efficient and predicted with an accuracy of nearly 75 percent. 
In addition to the Resnet152 model, we also built a custom CNN model with convolution layers and with the use of Pooling. We observed the accuracies with a small number of epochs at first and tuned the model accordingly by adding layers and changing the pooling type.
